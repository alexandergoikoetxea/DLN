# Bold and Italics

## Bold

To put text in bold, use two asterisks: **This is bold text**

I think you can also use underscores: __This is also bold__

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\

## Italicise

Just use a single asterisk or underscore: *this is italicised*

_This is also italicised_

## A combination of both

You can combine both **bold** and *italics* using combination of underscores and asterisks: _**This text is italicised and bolded**_

# Line ruling

You can rule lines like this:

---

Or like this:

___

Or like this:

***

# Quotes and Code Blocks

## Quotes

To add quotes, use and greater than sign:

> This is a quote

This is a multi-line quote:

> Here are some multiline quotes.
> Another line
> Quotes get put on the same line, if space allows

## Code blocks

To make a code block in your text, use three backticks

```
install.packages("tidiverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

You can also have codes within your text like this: `echo hello world!`

## Tables

You can make simple tables by using symbol and minus signs:

| column 1 | column 2 | column 3 |
|:----------|:----------:|----------:|
| item1 | item 2 | item 3 |
| ** bold** | *italics* | `code`|
| HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE ITEM | item 2 | item 3 |
| item 1 | item 2 | item 3 |
| item 1 | item 2 | item 3 |

## Item lists

### Ordered lists

1. This is the first item
   1. Sub item
1. This is the second item
3. This is the third item

## Unordered lists

Use either asterisk or minus sign:

* item 1
    * item 2

- item 3

## Check list

- [ ] checked list 1
- [x] checked list 1
- [ ] checked list 1

# Links and images

You can link stuff to your document like this: [etherpad](http://pad.carpentries.org/2018-11-13-otago-dc)

To put an image, use an exclamation mark before link:
