# Bold and Italics

## Bold

To put text in bold, use two asterisks: **This is bold text**

I think you can also use underscores: __This is also bold__

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\

## Italicise

Just use a single asterisk or underscore: *this is italicised*

_This is also italicised_

## A combination of both

You can combine both **bold** and *italics* using combination of underscores and asterisks: _**This text is italicised and bolded**_
